## With More Time

If I had more time, here’s what I’d dive into next:

### Animations

**Cover fade-in** as it loads, to signal that image is ready.  
**Tab transitions**—sliding or fading panels—to help orient the user when switching views.

### Accessibility First 

**Accessibility** Continue refining keyboard navigation, add comprehensive ARIA labels, and ensure all color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.

### Further Improvements  

Lazy-load offscreen content to speed up initial load.
